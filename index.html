            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Every job is a climate job - regardless of industry. This is especially true of product. All product managers can measure, build or refactor digital products in sustainable ways (product development). There are also huge opportunities to uncover in moving your own business, and those of your customers, forward to directly address the crisis (product strategy and management).</p>

                <p>Along with others in the Product community, I am passionate about reframing best practices to champion "the voice of the planet". For example, using a "Sustainability Square" for prioritizing effort, rather than the "iron triangle".</p>
